Advanced Data Center Infrastructure & Secure Wireless Delivery System1. Project Overview & MotivationThis project is a comprehensive network simulation designed in Cisco Packet Tracer to mirror a modern enterprise data center environment.As a Network Engineer Trainee, I developed this architecture to bridge the gap between theoretical certification studies and practical, hands-on implementation.The primary objective was to build a robust hosting environment that supports high-availability server clusters and provides secure web/file access to end-users via both wired and wireless technologies.This project serves as a "Proof of Concept" for a service provider or enterprise-level ISP looking to host public-facing services while maintaining a secure internal management structure.2. Network Architecture & Device InventoryThe topology is segmented into functional zones to ensure scalability and security:Data Center Server Area: Consists of five dedicated servers (Server0–Server4) acting as a high-density server farm for file storage and web hosting.Core & Distribution Layer: * 3560-24PS Multilayer Switch: Acts as the "brain" of the internal network, handling inter-VLAN routing and core traffic switching.2950-24PT Switches (Switch2 & Switch3): Provide redundant access paths for the server farm, ensuring no single point of failure at the access layer.Security Zone (DMZ): A dedicated 2960 Switch and DMZ Server isolated from the main server farm to host services accessible to the public internet.Edge & ISP Simulation: * ISR 4331 Router: Handles edge routing, NAT, and external security policies.Cable Modem & Cloud-PT: Simulates the connection to the WAN/Internet backbone.Wireless Access Point: A WRT300N Wireless Router providing a bridge for mobile workstations (Laptop0) to verify network services remotely.3. Technical Implementation & ConfigurationsA. Layer 2 Redundancy & TrunkingEtherChannel: I configured Port-channel 1 and Port-channel 12 to bundle multiple physical links into a single logical interface, increasing total bandwidth and providing instant failover if a cable fails.802.1Q Trunking: All inter-switch links use dot1q encapsulation to carry traffic for multiple VLANs across the core.VLAN Segmentation: Configured VLAN 1 as a management interface with a dedicated SVI ($10.0.0.1/24$) to allow remote administration of the networking hardware.B. Layer 3 Routing & Traffic FlowStatic & Default Routing: The router is configured with a Default Route ($0.0.0.0/0$) pointing toward the ISP ($192.168.10.2$) and specific Static Routes for internal subnet reachability (e.g., $192.168.1.0/24$).NAT (Network Address Translation): Implemented to map private internal IP addresses to a public-facing IP, allowing the internal servers to communicate with the cloud while remaining hidden from direct external exposure.C. Security & Access ControlExtended Named ACLs: Developed a security policy titled "secure_dc" to protect the $10.0.0.0$ server network.Permit TCP WWW: Allows external users to access web services (Port 80).Permit ICMP: Allows pinging for connectivity testing.Explicit Deny: A deny ip any any rule ensures all unauthorized traffic is dropped by default.DMZ Isolation: Positioned public-facing servers in a separate zone so that a breach of a web server does not grant access to the internal data center.D. Wireless Connectivity SetupStatic WAN Assignment: The wireless router is assigned a static IP of 192.168.1.5 to ensure it remains reachable within the local infrastructure.DHCP Services: Enabled a DHCP Server on the wireless LAN to automatically assign IP addresses in the 192.168.0.100–149 range to any laptop or mobile device connecting to the network.4. Conclusion & Continuous LearningThis project successfully demonstrates a fully functional, multi-tier network capable of professional-grade service delivery. It highlights my proficiency in Cisco IOS, network security design, and hardware troubleshooting.Trainee Note: This project is a reflection of my current technical journey. I am constantly refining my skills in automation and advanced security. If you are an experienced engineer and notice any flaws in the logic, architecture, or configuration commands, I would greatly appreciate your feedback. Please reach out via email or LinkedIn—I am eager to rectify errors and improve my design methodology.
